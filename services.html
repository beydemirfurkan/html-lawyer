        <p class="text-sm text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400 mt-8 leading-8">He assaulted me! If you watched any crime
          drama then
          you've
          seen many victims of a crime, attorneys, police officers, and judges use this term frequently. But in reality,
          what that person is often referring to is the charge of Battery. In Illinois, there is a distinction between
          Battery and Assault.

        </p><br>
        <p class="text-sm text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400 mt-2">Think of Assault as more of a threat to commit a
          Battery (Example: I’m going to punch you in the face).
          Battery is when an individual causes physical harm to another (punching another in the face) or makes
          insulting or provoking physical contact with another (spitting on someone).</p>
        <br>
        <p class="text-sm text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400 mt-2">More importantly, Battery and Assault carry two
          different punishments, Battery is a class A misdemeanor and
          Assault is a class C misdemeanor. If you have been charged with any of these you better contemplate in hiring
          an assault & battery lawyer near you.</p>
